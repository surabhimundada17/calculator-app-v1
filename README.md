**Project Overview:**  
This is a modern, responsive calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), includes a clear function, and gracefully handles invalid inputs, such as division by zero. The design emphasizes a clean, attractive look with smooth button animations and adaptability for various devices.

**Setup Instructions:**  
- Save the provided code into an `.html` file, e.g., `calculator.html`.  
- Open the file in any web browser to use the calculator. No external dependencies or setup steps are required.

**Usage Guide:**  
- Click on digit buttons (0-9) and the decimal point to enter numbers.  
- Use the operator buttons (+, −, ×, ÷) to specify the operation.  
- Click the '=' button to compute and display the result.  
- Use the 'C' button to clear the current input and reset the calculator.  
- The calculator initializes with a default display of '0'.  
- Handles attempts to divide by zero by showing an alert and resetting.

**Enhancements from Iteration 0:**  
- Implemented a fully functional calculator supporting continuous calculations.  
- Added graceful handling for division by zero using alert and reset.  
- Improved UI responsiveness and aesthetics, including grid layout, animations, and responsive media queries.  
- Modularized event handling for clarity and maintainability.  
- Ensured the display updates dynamically to reflect user input and results.
