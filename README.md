**Project Overview:**  
This is an upgraded, modern, responsive calculator web application that includes basic arithmetic operations and adds scientific functions such as sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), and square root (√). The UI features a sleek, animated design with gradient buttons and adaptive layout for both mobile and desktop environments.

**Setup Instructions:**  
- Save the above code as an `.html` file, e.g., `scientific_calculator.html`.  
- Open the file in any modern web browser to use the calculator.

**Usage Guide:**  
- Click number buttons (0-9) and decimal point "." to input numbers.  
- Click operation buttons (+, −, ×, ÷) to select an arithmetic operation.  
- To perform scientific functions, click one of the top scientific buttons (sin, cos, tan, √) after entering a number or a result; it applies the function to the current input.  
- Use "=" to compute the current expression's result.  
- Press "C" to clear the calculator.  
- The display updates in real-time with each interaction.  
- Handles errors such as division by zero or invalid square root inputs gracefully with alerts.

**Enhancements from Previous Version:**  
- Added scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, sqrt) accessible via dedicated buttons.  
- Maintained all existing functions such as basic arithmetic, clear, and responsive design.  
- Improved user experience with animated buttons that respond nicely on hover and click.  
- Robust input handling ensuring the calculator performs accurately and handles invalid inputs cleanly.
